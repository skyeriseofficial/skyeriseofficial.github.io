                <div class="story-intro">
                    <p><strong>Hi there! I'm Skye Energy Gibbs</strong>, and I spent 8 years as a competitive gymnast. I trained at Sugar Land Gymnastics, then moved to World Champions Centre under Coach Cecile and Coach Laurent (Simone Biles' coaches), competing through Level 8 and training up to Level 9. I know what it takes to succeed in this sport, and I also know what it costs.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>I walked away from competitive gymnastics before completing Level 9. It wasn't about talent or work ethic. It was about not having the mental support I needed, and not even knowing how to ask for it. The truth is, emotional support should be as standard in this sport as physical training, but it's not. My parents loved me and tried to help. My coaches wanted me to succeed. But what I really needed was someone who'd been in my shoes, who understood the specific mental challenges of competitive gymnastics from the inside, and who had dedicated time solely focused on me and my emotional wellbeing around the sport. If I'd had that, things could have been different. That's why I created SkyeRise.</p>

                <div class="credentials-text">
                    <h3>My Training Background</h3>
                    <p>Training at World Champions Centre alongside Olympic champions gave me insight into the highest levels of the sport. But it also showed me how universal the mental struggles are, no matter what level you're competing.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>During my time competing, I experienced coaching changes that completely shifted my training environment. I faced fear of skills that kept me up at night. I was continuously being pushed before I was ready to move up levels and attempt new skills. My entire identity became wrapped up in the sport, and when things got difficult, I didn't know how to separate who I was from what I could do in the gym.</p>
            
            <p>These aren't just my experiences. They're what so many young gymnasts face, and most of them struggle in silence without knowing where to turn for support.</p>
            
            <p><strong>That's why your gymnast needs this.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Competitive gymnastics is one of the most mentally demanding sports a young person can pursue. The reality is that training can truly feel like a full-time job, and on top of that, so much is outside of their control: different coaching styles, injuries that cause setbacks, growth spurts that affect their skills, dangerous mental blocks on abilities they used to do easily, and constant comparison to teammates. When everything feels chaotic, gymnasts need to have the mental tools to know come back to themselves, to remember who they are, why they started, and what they truly want from the sport.</p>
            
            <p>I'm 18, which means I just lived through everything your gymnast is experiencing right now. I'm not looking back at gymnastics from decades ago. I understand the exact pressures they're facing: the comparison struggles, the fear of disappointing people, the complicated relationship with their body and appearance, the weight of expectations, and the identity crisis when gymnastics becomes their whole world.</p>
            
            <p>Through one-on-one coaching and mentoring, I help young gymnasts (ages 6-17) work through fear, manage pressure, process difficult changes, and make empowered decisions about their gymnastics journey. Whether that means pushing forward with renewed confidence or recognizing when it's time to step back, I'm here to support them through it.</p>
            
            <p>The physical training your gymnast receives at their gym is important and valuable. But the mental and emotional support? That's often missing. And that's the piece that can make or break their experience and longevity in the sport.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your gymnast is pouring everything into this sport. They deserve someone focused on their wellbeing, helping them maintain perspective and remember that they are so much more than their gymnastics.</strong></p>
            
            <p>That's what SkyeRise provides. Let's work together.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">How do I know if my gymnast needs this?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        If your gymnast is experiencing fear of skills, loss of motivation, anxiety about competitions, pressure from coaches, or seems to be losing their love for the sport, coaching and mentoring can help. Even gymnasts who seem "fine" benefit from having a safe space to process the mental and emotional demands of competitive training.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What happens in a typical session?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Sessions are personalized to your gymnast's needs. We might work on visualization techniques for scary skills, process feelings about coaching or competition pressure, practice confidence-building exercises, or simply create a space where your gymnast can vent and be heard. Every session is judgment-free and focused on what matters most to them.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between coaching and mentoring?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        I offer both! Coaching focuses on specific techniques like visualization, fear management strategies, and mental skills training. Mentoring is more about listening, supporting, and guiding your gymnast through their challenges with someone who's been there. Most sessions naturally blend both approaches based on what your gymnast needs that day.
                    </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do you work with parents too?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Yes! The free 15-minute consultation is specifically for parents to discuss their gymnast's challenges and goals. I can also provide guidance to parents on how to best support their gymnast outside of our sessions. However, the coaching and mentoring sessions themselves are one-on-one with the gymnast to create a safe, confidential space.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What ages do you work with?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        I work with gymnasts ages 6 to 17. My approach adapts to each age group. Younger gymnasts might focus more on building confidence and managing fear, while older athletes often work on deeper identity issues, burnout prevention, and preparing for life beyond gymnastics.

                <div class="faq-item">

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Every gymnast is different. Some see immediate relief after just one session of being heard and validated. Others need several sessions to work through deeper mental blocks or rebuild motivation. Consistency is key. Gymnasts who commit to regular sessions (weekly or bi-weekly) typically see the most significant and lasting changes.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do sessions work logistically?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        All sessions are conducted via Google Meet, so your gymnast can connect from anywhere with an internet connection. Sessions are scheduled at times that work for your family's busy gymnastics schedule. Flexible scheduling available.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        I am not a licensed therapist. I'm a former competitive gymnast who understands the unique mental and emotional challenges of the sport firsthand. I provide mentorship, mindset coaching, and a safe space for gymnasts to process their experiences. If your gymnast is dealing with severe anxiety, depression, or trauma, I recommend working with a licensed mental health professional in addition to or instead of coaching.

                <div class="faq-item">

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        That's completely normal! Many gymnasts are nervous about opening up at first. I create a comfortable, judgment-free environment where they can share at their own pace. Sometimes just knowing someone "gets it" because they've lived it makes all the difference. The free consultation also helps ease any nervousness.
